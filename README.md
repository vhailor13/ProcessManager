# ProcessManager

Notes:

Did not have enaugh time to debug it properly, there are still some things to fix/improve:

- More elegant way to update processes list. Ideally move update logic inside XCP service.
- Better way to sync filter flag. (Do not use UserDefaults)
- Explore better ways to operate with processes (currently using bash)
- Fix onUpdate block in ProgressManager main app
